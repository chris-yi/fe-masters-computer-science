// ****** Set Data NOTES ****** //
/*

1.  Set and data are completely different.  A set is more like an object.

2. You can think of it as a cloud, you run set.add(5), it'll just add a 5 into the pool.

3.  A set cannot have any duplicates, so if you add 5 again, it will do nothing.

4.  Very useful when you have a large data set that you want to take our all the duplicates.

5.  Case: Username, cannot have duplicates of usernames.

6.  A set allows at least four things, add, remove, contains and toList.
